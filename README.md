# Advent of Code 2025

The 2025 edition of Advent of Code, written in Scala 3.7 this year! Uses sbt 1.11 as the build tool.

**Puzzle inputs are not included**.[^1] Create the `src/main/resources` directory and add your inputs with the filename `day[nn].txt`, replacing `[nn]` with the two digit day number (so, the input for day 1 is `day01.txt`).

Tests are written in ScalaTest with ScalaCheck property based testing where appropriate.

[^1]: See https://adventofcode.com/2024/about, specifically "Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code?", which says:

    "If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs."
